# Magic-Format-Randomizer

A randomizer that randomly generates a Magic the Gathering format/ruleset. You can choose how far the randomizer can "deviate" from a normal ruleset, a low number being normal and a high number being unusual. Additionally, you can also determine how many sets to make legal as well. The randomizer will randomly select the specified number of sets. Lastly, you can choose whether you want the randomizer to modify gameplay rules or deckbuilding rules for additional chaos.

Note: This randomizer supports all sets up to Core Set 2021. Any sets release after have not been included in this randomizer.
